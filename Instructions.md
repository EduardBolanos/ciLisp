# Task 1
We will be constructing abstract syntax trees representing the input s-expressions. Subsequently, the root of the abstract syntax tree will be passed to an evaluation function eval() that should evaluate the abstract syntax tree executing de facto the compiled version of the s-expression based program. In this way, function eval() implements a virtual machine executing compiled ciLisp programs in a way analogous to the way a JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes compiled Java bytecode.

ciLisp programs uses the Cambridge Polish Notation (CPN) that is a special prefix notation for expressions (that we will call s-expressions), in which the operator name and the operands are enclosed in parentheses. For example, 1+2 (or add(1,2)) is denoted as:

(add 1 2)

The initial grammar for ciLisp is as follows:

program ::= s-expr EOL  

s-expr ::= 
      quit 
    | number 
    | f-expr   

f-expr ::= ( func s-expr ) | ( func s-expr s-expr )

func ::= neg|abs|exp|sqrt|add|sub|mult|div|remainder|log|pow|max|min|exp2|cbrt|hypot

number ::= digit+ [ . digit+ ]  

digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

The project already includes the code to construct basic abstract syntax trees consisting of numbers and one or two parameter functions. ciLisp is still a purely functional language with no side effects. All computation is based on function composition. Your task is to implement the evaluation function eval(). 

Please note that a parameter VERBOSE has been added to BISON_TARGET in CMakeLists.txt. That forces generation of a report file from the parser called ciLispParser.ouput and located in cmake-build-debug directory. It is worth exploring that file to get insight in the state machine that the parser generates and to check if there are any issues in the parsing like shift/reduce conflicts. Keep in mind that bison can deal with many conflicts, but it's possible for it to get confused with more complex issues.

# Task 2
The following grammar extends the ciLisp grammar to accommodate variables that in Lisp jargon are called symbols. Variables exist in potentially nested scopes that can be defined by the let section construct preceding ciLisp functions. Each symbol assumes a value represented by the associated sexpression. A symbol can be any number of small and capital letters.

program ::= s-expr EOL  

s-expr ::=       
     quit  
   | number     
   | symbol  
   | f-expr 
   | ( scope s_expr ) 

 f-expr ::= ( func s-expr ) | ( func s-expr s-expr ) 

 func ::= neg|abs|exp|sqrt|add|sub|mult|div|remainder|log|pow|max|min|exp2|cbrt|hypot  

 scope ::= <empty> | ( let_list )  

 let_list ::= let_elem | let_list let_elem   

 let_elem ::= ( let symbol s_expr )  

 number ::= digit+ [ . digit+ ]  
 
 symbol ::= letter+  

 letter ::= [a-zA-Z] 

 digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9  

Here are some sample expressions that use symbols:

(add ((let (abc 1)) (sub 3 abc)) 4)  
(mult ((let (a 1) (b 2)) (add a b)) (sqrt 2))  
(add ((let (a ((let (b 2)) (mult b (sqrt 10))))) (div a 2)) ((let (c 5))(sqrt c)))  
((let (first (sub 5 1)) (second 2)) (add (pow 2 first) (sqrt second)))

As you see, s-expressions are first class objects, so they can be assigned to variables. Implement a bison-based parser of the language built over this grammar that creates a syntax tree and a symbol table of all identifiers. Assume static scoping. That means that there will be multiple symbol tables associated with the roots of the expressions within which they are defined. For example, using the following code sample,there would be a symbol table associated with sub in the outer expression, and another associated with add in the inner expression:

((let (abc 1)) (sub ((let (abc 2) (de 3)) (add abc de)) abc))

Missing symbols, for example as in the following expression:  
 
((let (abc 1)) (sub ((let (abc 2)) (add abc de)) abc)) 

Should be treated as compilation errors. Redefining a symbol in the same scope is not allowed and should be flagged as an error. You should use a linked list to keep the symbols. You will need to keep symbol names along with their values. Note that the value may be an s-expression, so you should just keep a pointer to the root of the corresponding abstract syntax tree (that obviously may be just one element, the root holding the value, in the extreme case).

typedef struct symbol_table_node { 
    char *ident;  
    struct ast_node *val; 
    struct symbol_table_node *next; 
} SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE;

Add a link to the scope to AST_NODE:

typedef struct ast_node {
    AST_NODE_TYPE type; 
    SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE *scope; 
    struct ast_node *parent; 
    union { 
        NUMBER_AST_NODE number; 
        FUNC_AST_NODE function;
        SYMBOL_AST_NODE symbol; 
    } data; 
} AST_NODE;

You will need to add an AST node for symbol references to the nodes available for constructing abstract syntax trees of the programs.

typedef struct symbol_ast_node { 
    char *name; 
} SYMBOL_AST_NODE;

To implement the evaluation function that executes this and similar programs the code will have to perform symbol table lookups. ciLisp uses static scoping rules with the nested scoping principle, so you need to explore not only the scope associated with a given s-expression, but also the scopes of all its ancestors. That's what the link parent in AST_NODE is for. Such lookups may go up to the very root of the AST tree. A symbol reference in an s-expression should be declared undefined on after exploring all nested scopes. Keep in mind that symbols may hold s-expressions rather than straight numerical values. Therefore, you may need to evaluate s-expressions that are bound to the symbols before using the symbols for further evaluation. Write a program in ciLisp that forces the compiler and the evaluator to test the new functionality (both positively and negatively). 

For example, the following expressions should compile and evaluate with no errors:

(add ((let (abcd 1)) (sub 3 abcd)) 4)  
(mult ((let (a 1) (b 2)) (add a b)) (sqrt 2))  
(add ((let (a ((let (b 2)) (mult b (sqrt 10))))) (div a 2)) ((let (c 5)) (sqrt c)))  
((let (first (sub 5 1)) (second 2)) (add (pow 2 first) (sqrt second)))  
((let (a ((let (c 3) (d 4)) (mult c d)))) (sqrt a))

# Task 3
The following grammar further expands the capabilities of ciLisp by adding types for variables:

Integers should provide precision equivalent to a long integer in C.
Reals should have a precision equivalent to double in C.

program ::= s-expr EOL 

s-expr ::=       
     quit  
   | number  
   | symbol  
   | f-expr
   | ( scope s_expr )

 f-expr ::= ( func s-expr ) | ( func s-expr s-expr )  

 func ::= neg|abs|exp|sqrt|add|sub|mult|div|remainder|log|pow|max|min|exp2|cbrt|hypot 

 scope ::= <empty> | ( let let_list )  

 let_list ::= let_elem | let_list let_elem   
 
 let_elem ::= ( type symbol s_expr ) 

 type ::= <empty> | integer | real 

 number ::= digit+ [ . digit+ ]  
 
 symbol ::= letter+  

 letter ::= [a-zA-Z] 

 digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 

Type is optional; symbols are assumed to be real (double) by default. All internal computation is done with doubles. All numbers are assumed to be doubles.

This task needs an extension to SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE definition to indicate the type of the data:

typedef enum { NO_TYPE, INTEGER_TYPE, REAL_TYPE } DATA_TYPE;  

typedef struct symbol_table_node { 
    DATA_TYPE val_type; 
    char *ident; 
    struct ast_node *val; 
    struct symbol_table_node *next; 
} SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE;

To handle types of computed s-expressions, the evaluator needs to return a structure that includes the value along with its type.

typedef struct return_value { 
    DATA_TYPE type; 
    double value; 
} RETURN_VALUE;

RETURN_VALUE eval(AST_NODE *);

If an expression of type real is assigned to a symbol declared as integer, then the value of the expression should be rounded down or up before the assignment; e.g., 1.49 to 1, and 1.69 to 2. Each time such a coersion is performed, the evaluator should issue a warning:

   "WARNING: incompatible type assignment for variables <name>"

Adding, subtracting, multiplying, or negating operands of type integer should yield an s-expression with type integer; otherwise (i.e., if one of the operands is real), the type should be real. All other operations should return real values.

# Task 4
The following grammar expands the capabilities of ciLisp by adding print function.

program ::= s-expr EOL 

s-expr ::=       
     quit  
   | number  
   | symbol  
   | f-expr 
   | ( scope s_expr )

f-expr ::= ( func s-expr ) | ( func s-expr s-expr )   

func ::= neg|abs|exp|sqrt|add|sub|mult|div|remainder|log|pow|max|min|exp2|cbrt|hypot  

scope ::= <empty> | ( let let_list )  

let_list ::= let_elem | let_list let_elem  

let_elem ::= ( type symbol s_expr )

type ::= <empty> | integer | real 
 
number ::= digit+ [ . digit+ ]  

symbol ::= letter+  
 
letter ::= [a-zA-Z] 

digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

The following expression:

(print s_expr) 

Should print the value of the s-expression in the format depending on the type of the expression:

1.  Real variables should print with double precision with two spaces after the dot (even if there are only zeros to the right of the dot).
2.  Untyped values should print as real values. 
3.  And integer variables should print without any fraction part.

The width of the print field should be minimized; i.e., values should use a tight format (no padding on the left).
For example: 

((let (integer a 1))(print a)) 
 
 = 1 
 
((let (real b 10))(print b)) 
 
 = 10.00 
 
(print 100) 
 
 = 100.00

# Task 5
The following grammar expands the capability of ciLisp by adding support for parameter lists of arbitrary length.

program ::= s-expr EOL  
 
s-expr ::=       
     quit  
   | number  
   | symbol  
   | ( func s_expr_list )  
   | ( scope s_expr )  
   | ( cond s_expr s_expr s_expr )  
 
 func ::= neg|abs|exp|sqrt|add|sub|mult|div|remainder|log|pow|max|min|exp2|cbrt|hypot|print|equal|smaller|larger 

 s_expr_list ::= s_expr s_expr_list | s_expr | <empty>  
 
 scope ::= <empty> | ( let let_list ) 

 let_list ::= let_elem | let_list let_elem  

 let_elem ::= ( type symbol s_expr )  

 type ::= <empty> | integer | real  

 number ::= digit+ [ . digit+ ]  

 symbol ::= letter+  

 letter ::= [a-zA-Z]  
 
 digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
 
The number of parameters in the list of parameters must meet the needs of the function. If there are too few parameters provided, the evaluator should issue a runtime error:

   "ERROR: too few parameters for the function <name>" 

and return the value of 0.0 (with type real, of course).
If more than necessary parameters are provided for a given function, then the evaluator should use as many as appropriate, and issue a runtime warning:

  "WARNING: too many parameters for the function <name>"
    
 The operations of addition and multiplication should accommodate any number of parameters.
 To allow creations of lists of s-expressions, a link next is added to AST_NODE:

 typedef struct ast_node {    
    AST_NODE_TYPE type;  
    SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE *scope;  
    struct ast_node *parent;  
    union {  
        NUMBER_AST_NODE number;  
        FUNC_AST_NODE function;  
        COND_AST_NODE condition;     
        SYMBOL_AST_NODE symbol;  
    } data;  
    struct ast_node *next;  
} AST_NODE;

The structure for the ast node for functions is also modifed, so it points to a list of parameters rather than just two:

typedef struct {  
    char *name;  
    struct ast_node *opList;  
} FUNC_AST_NODE;

Expand the functionality of add, mult, and print, so they can handle multiple operands.
For example,
(add 1 2 3 4 5) 

= 15.00 

Print should print the values of all s-expressions in the list in one line separated by spaces and return the value of the last s-expression in the list as its own value.

((let (integer a 1)(real b 2))(print a b 3)

=> 1 2.00 3.00

= 3.00 

# Task 6
The following grammar expands the capability of ciLisp by adding conditional expressions and capability to read user provided and random values:

program ::= s-expr EOL  

s-expr ::=       
     quit  
   | number  
   | symbol  
   | ( func s_expr_list ) 
   | ( scope s_expr ) 
   | ( cond s_expr s_expr s_expr ) 

 func ::= neg|abs|exp|sqrt|add|sub|mult|div|remainder|log|pow|max|min|exp2|cbrt|hypot|print|rand|read|equal|smaller|larger 

 scope ::= <empty> | ( let let_list )  
 
 let_list ::= let_elem | let_list let_elem   
 
 let_elem ::= ( type symbol s_expr )  
 
 type ::= <empty> | integer | real 

 number ::= digit+ [ . digit+ ]  
 
 symbol ::= letter+  
 
 letter ::= [a-zA-Z] 

 digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

The following is the summary of changes:

1. Added read as a parameter less function that takes values from the user.  The user should be prompted to enter a value by displaying a prompt:

    read :=
    
    A symbol can be set to a value obtained in from the input as follows:
    
    ((let (integer a (read)) (real b (read))) (print a b))  
    read := 3  
    read := 5.0 
    
    => 3 5.00 
    
    5.00
    
NOTES:
    
    i. The numbers entered by the user are in red just for visualization. Your program should not attempt to apply any colors to printouts.
    ii. If read is used to set a variable, then the user should be prompted only once for its value. The successive references to the variable should be resolved to the value that was read in the read section.
   
2. Added rand as a function that generates pseudo-random numbers. The function does not take any parameters. It can be called as follows:

    ((let (a 100)) (cond (smaller (rand) 100) (add a 2) (sub a 2)))
    
The values generated by rand and read should be considered double unless assigned to a variable typed as integer.
    
3. Added comparison functions equal, smaller, and larger. The functions return 1 if the condition holds, and 0 otherwise.

4. Added cond function that checks if the first s-expression is true (non-zero). If so, then the next expression is evaluated and returned. Otherwise, the third s-expression is evaluated and returned. For example:

((let (myA (read))(myB (rand)))(cond (smaller myA myB) (print myA) (print myB)))

Should print the value of myA if the expression (smaller myA myB) is true (non-zero); otherwise, the value of myB should be printed. If the function is not one of the relationship functions (i.e., neither equal, smaller, nor larger), then the expression should be evaluated, and if it equals to zero, then the condition should be considered false; otherwise (any value other than zero), the condition should be considered true. You will need another AST_NODE type to encode the condition in the abstract syntax tree. The following is a prototype for that node:

typedef struct {   
    struct ast_node *cond; 
    struct ast_node *zero; 
    struct ast_node *nonzero; 
} COND_AST_NODE;

typedef struct ast_node {    
    AST_NODE_TYPE type;  
    SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE *scope;  
    struct ast_node *parent;  
    union {  
        NUMBER_AST_NODE number;  
        FUNC_AST_NODE function;  
        COND_AST_NODE condition; 
        SYMBOL_AST_NODE symbol;  
    } data;  
} AST_NODE;

# Task 7
The following grammar expands the capability of ciLisp by adding support for user-defined functions:

program ::= s-expr EOL 

s-expr ::=       
     quit  
   | number  
   | symbol  
   | ( func s_expr_list ) 
   | ( scope s_expr ) 
   | ( cond s_expr s_expr s_expr ) 
   | ( symbol s_expr_list ) 

 func ::= neg|abs|exp|sqrt|add|sub|mult|div|remainder|log|pow|max|min|exp2|cbrt|hypot|rand|read|print|equal|smaller|larger  

 s_expr_list ::= s_expr s_expr_list | s_expr 
 
 scope ::= <empty> | ( let let_list )  

 let_list ::= let_elem | let_list let_elem  

 let_elem ::= ( type symbol s_expr ) | ( type symbol lambda ( arg_list ) s_expr )

 type ::= <empty> | integer | real 

 arg_list ::= symbol arg_list | symbol 

 number ::= digit+ [ . digit+ ] 

 symbol ::= letter+  

 letter ::= [a-zA-Z] 

 digit ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9

Function definitions should be placed in the let section. A function should have a positive number of formal arguments (symbols).The body of the function is an expression that may use formal parameters. For example:

((let (real myFunc lambda (x y) (mult (add x 5) (sub y 2)))) (sub (myFunc 3 5) 2))

Similarly to the use of let and cond, the lambda keyword should be used just for parsing.

As shown, a function must be called with the number of actual parameters that comply with the arity rules described in the previous task for lists of function parameters. The same errors and warnings should be issues as needed. The value of the expression that is the body of the function is the value that the function returns. Formal parameters have type ARG_TYPE and have NULL as values. 
For example, in the tree for ((let (f lambda (x y) (add x y)))(f (sub 5 2) (mult 2 3))) x and y are symbols in the scope of add with type ARG_TYPE, and with x.val = NULL and y.val = NULL. When the evaluator processes (f (sub 5 2) (mult 2 3)), it will construct an individual stack for each of the formal parameters using x.stack and y.stack. 
The stacks are implemented as linked lists that use STACK_NODE. The x.stack->val field of the top of the first stack points to the root of the tree for (sub 5 2) and y.stack->val to the root of the tree for (mult 2 3). In this way, both formal parameters now have individual stacks with the tops pointing to the actual parameters (i.e., the roots of the corresponding s-expression trees). Now, (add x y) can be evaluated as both x and y can be resolved by evaluating the actual parameters from the top of their respective calling stacks. After the evaluation, the tops of both x.stack and y.stack must be popped.

This task needs some modifications and extra definitions to the list of symbols in a scope:

typedef enum { VARIABLE_TYPE, LAMBDA_TYPE, ARG_TYPE } SYMBOL_TYPE;

typedef struct stack_node {
    struct ast_node *val;
    struct stack_node *next; 
    } STACK_NODE; 

typedef struct symbol_table_node {
    SYMBOL_TYPE type;
    DATA_TYPE val_type;
    char *ident;
    struct ast_node *val;
    STACK_NODE *stack;
    struct symbol_table_node *next;
    } SYMBOL_TABLE_NODE;

# Task 8
Implement evaluator handling of recursive custom functions.
The evaluator should handle expression similar to the following:

((let (integer a 1) (f lambda (x y) (add x y)))(f 2 (f a 3)))

To handle recursive calls, subsequent recursive invocations require pushing sets of actual parameters on the stack. All individual stacks associated with formal parameters hold actual parameters corresponding to subsequent recursive invocations of a function. 
For our sample expression, after the recursive invocation of f the stack for x is x.stack->a->2 (simplified view; the actual stack uses the STACK_NODE structure) and the stack for y is y.stack->3->(f a 3) (where a and 3 correspondingly stack tops for formal parameters x and y). After (f a 3) is evaluated (as (add a 3) with x<-a and y<-3 substitutions) the stacks will be x.stack->2 and y.stack->4, since a is poppped from x.stack and 3 is popped from y.stack, and the evaluation of (add a 3) is 4 for a set to 1 in the scope.
